Fix airwires
Min trace width of 10 for signals, 30 for power
Leave pads straight out instead of skewed
Keep a trace width between traces
Add a GND polygon to the bottom side
Via stitch the GND planes
Mounting holes/standoffs, make sure they are aligned and sane. You might only fit 3, thats ok
SW, 12V, 24V, related should be width 30
Do not route anything through the region near an oscillator
Swap CAN_H, CAN_L with +12V, GND on the input T2I connector, move the CAN transceiver down instead
Bulk cap goes up top
